# IronmanLog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Note

If you would like to run this app locally, you will need to create a "config.ts" file and put it in the "app" folder which is inside the "src" folder. This contains an API key for Google Fonts, which is needed for the font picker in Style Settings. The contents of this file are as follows (keep the single quotes around the key): 
`export const DEFAULT_FONT_PICKER_CONFIG = {
   apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
 };`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
